# StudentDB
A backend Fullstack Functional Student DB Using the N Tier Model


RELATED DEFINITIONS AND CONTEXT

- IN YOUR CHOICE OF IDE IF YOU GO TO POM.XML (UNDER SRC FOLDER) AND LOOK UNDER <dependencies> 
  THIS IS WHERE YOULL FIND THE ADD ON DEPENDENCIES THAT YOU DONWLOAD ORIGINALLY  

- UNDER MAIN YOU HAVE RESOURCES/STATIC/TEMPLATES THIS IS MAINLY FOR WEB DEVELOPMENT AND FRONT END WORK

- FAILED TO DETERMINE A SUITABLE DRIVER (IN THIS INSTANCE) REFERS TO FAILING TO CONNECT TO A DB :(

- THE @RestController MAKES CLASS SERVE AS REST ENDPOINTS AND INITIATES REST ARCHITECTURE 

- EVERY STUDENT CONSIST OF AN ID, NAME, EMAIL, DOB, AND AGE :) 

- THIS PROJECTS FOLLOWS THE N-TIER MODEL

- "@RequestMapping(path = "api/vz/student")" THIS IS OUR PATH THAT YOU WILL FIND IN THE URL 
		
		"ex: localhost:8080/api/v1/student"

- THE LAYERS ARE 
	- CLIENT
	- API
	- SERVICE 
	- DATA ACCESS

- SO IN POSTGRE SQL WE IF YOUR USING THE GUI, WE RIGHT CLICK ON THE NEWLY CREATED DB
	CLICK PSQL TOOL AND TYPE IN CREATE DATABASE example_db
	TYPE /l TO VERIFY ITS ON THERE 
	GRANT ALL PRIVELAGES ON DATABASE "example_db" TO user 
	THEN DO THE SAME BUT GIVE PERMISSIONS TO postgres IN REPLACE OF user 
	/c TO CONNECT TO THE DB 
	
	AND IT SHOULD BE ALL GOOD :) IF YOUR DEPENDENCY IS WORKING CORRECTLY IN JAVA (SPRING) THEN IT SHOULD CONNECT 
	THIS CAN BE VERIFIED THROUGH THE HIKARI POOLBASE LOGS 

- THEN GO TO DATABSE IN THE INTELLJ IDE AND CLICK NEW DB SOURCE THEN CLICK POSTGRESQL

- YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU SPECIFY THE DB YOUR LOOKING FOR AND THAT EVERYTHING IS CORRECT 
- TEST CONNECTION 
- IF YOU GET A SCRAM-ATHENTICATION ERROR JUST GO TO POM.XML AND SPECIFY A USER AND PASSWORD AND THEN TYPE THAT INTO THE ADD DB SOURCE VALUES
